## Abnegation residences

All the houses in Abnegation looked the same from the outside for the most part. They were simple structures with nothing extra. A private bathroom and bedroom was the most luxurious architectures. Amity was alike in their cabins, but where the Amity had personal style in the creation of their cabins, the Abnegation did not. Left to decorate to show personal style, many Abnegation homes seem bland as the most traditional of Abnegation folks still see art and creativity and personal style as vanity. Though Progressives are working hard to change that mindset, the exterior of the residences will be the last thing to see a revitalization and reform. Abnegation style homes come with a kitchenette or larger, an open family room, at least one bathroom, and between 0 and 3 bedrooms. Two and three bedroom dwellings are reserved for family units with 4 or more Abnegation,
